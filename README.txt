Hello!

I've made a number of changes to the continued mod. You're welcome to use any of them in your own version. 
While the commits show the technical details, I wanted to explain the reasoning behind these edits here.
Think of this as something like a pull request. Though there are a few exceptions I'll explain below.

---

About
- Removed <url /> since it didn't contain anything.

---

Defs
- Many of the def files were nearly identical across versions, so I made them apply globally.

- I rewrote or polished most of the descriptions in the thingDef files. Some I left unchanged or only corrected grammar.
These are more personal edits, but they don't affect the language files. Meaning remains the same in each supported language.

- I split the long Defs/Things_Weapon/BA_RangedWeapon.xml into multiple files. This is also a personal choice, but it keeps things tidier and easier to navigate.

Patches
Overall, the patches had the same goals across versions, but some contained errors. Below are the details:

Patches/Vanilla.xml
- No errors here.
- Suggestion: use only PatchOperationAdd. Using PatchOperationSequence just to run a single patch is unnecessary.

Patches/VanillaFactionExpanded.xml
- No errors, but note: "VFEClaymore" doesn't exist in VFE - Medieval 1.4 (which this mod supports). That makes it redundant.

Patches/VanillaWeaponExpanded.xml
- Here we run into major issues. It looks like the verb classes were accidentally replaced with the comp class from BlackArmory.
- This breaks the weapons: pawns can equip them, but the fire button doesn't appear because the verb class isn't defined correctly.
- I corrected this issue.

Full error log:
Could not instantiate Verb (directOwner=CompEquippable(parent=VWE_Gun_Musket38197 at=(131, 0, 120))): System.InvalidCastException: Specified cast is not valid.

Patches/KitsGunpowderWeapons.xml
- Same redundancy issue as above.
- Additional note for Zal: your updated mod "Kit's Gunpowder Weapons (Continued)" uses a different name. Since PatchOperationFindMod look for exact names, the patch wasn't applying. I added an extra patch so it works with your version.

Patches for Versions 1.4 and 1.5
- These patches still use the old namespace. You used BlackArmory in 1.6, but the older ones point to BA_Class, which no longer exists.
- Simple fix: change it to BlackArmory (as done in 1.6).
- Also: don't forget to comment out <Smoke>Musket_Smoke</Smoke>.

---

Source and Assemblies
- I included a custom version of the BlackArmory C# code. Functionally itâ€™s the same, but lighter and easier to read.
- Both .dll files work, but note: the .dll in /Assemblies is the compiled version of the source files from the Source/BlackArmory_Custom folder, not from Source/BlackArmory.
- The one from Zal is the 1.6 version, which is placed in the Source/BlackArmory folder.

- I used the following when compiling:
  - Assembly-CSharp.dll
  - UnityEngine.dll
  - UnityEngine.CoreModule.dll
- Compiler: Mono C# (version 4.7.2).

Recap
Everything works across all supported versions. I made these changes for three main reasons:
1. To fix errors I ran into while playing with the continued version.
2. To share feedback and improvements with Zal (and make it easy for them to adopt changes).
3. For fun. I enjoy updating mods as a hobby sometimes.

You're free to:
- Copy any parts of this mod.
- Replace the whole thing.
- Edit the /Source folder as you see fit.
- Delete this README once you no longer need it.

If someone else stumbles across this, feel free to learn from it, use it, or simply enjoy the updated version.
